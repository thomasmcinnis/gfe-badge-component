# Badge Component Challenge

This is a very simple badge component built as part of a design system challenge
on [GreatFrontEnd Projects](https://www.greatfrontend.com/projects/challenges/badge-component).

## Implementation

My implementation is designed to match the specification as closely as possible,
and uses TypeScript and Tailwind.

The `Badge` component takes `role` and `size` defined in an interface of union
types.

## Testing

The `Badge` component has tests using `Vitest`, though the preview grid of
badges does not.

## Installation

After cloning the repo to your environment you can install dependencies and run
the dev server.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
